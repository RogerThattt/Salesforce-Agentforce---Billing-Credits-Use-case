# Salesforce-Agentforce---Billing-Credits-Use-case

🎯 Business Context:
Your contact center agents (Agentforce users) need to resolve billing disputes or offer goodwill credits during customer interactions.

The credits must be tracked, approved, and reflected in billing systems like Zuora, SAP, or Salesforce Billing.

Compliance requires justification and audit trail.

🧩 Key Salesforce Components Involved:
Object	Role
Case	Root object for customer complaints
Billing_Credit__c (Custom)	Represents a credit request
Agent__c	Lookup to user issuing credit
Approval_Process	Enforces manager approval above threshold
Account	Links credit to customer profile
Entitlement / Contract	Validates eligibility for credit
Integration Object / Platform Event	Sends to external billing system
Audit_Log__c	Tracks change history for regulatory reasons

🔁 Process Flow (Simplified):
Agent opens Case: "Overcharged by £10"

Agent creates Billing Credit record:

Fields: Amount, Reason, Type, Linked Case, Customer, Agent

System checks policy rules:

e.g., Max auto-credit = £20; else approval needed

Approval flow triggers (if required)

Once approved, credit is:

Logged in Salesforce

Sent to Billing system via integration

Credit Applied + Case Resolved
